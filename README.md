# Skies Below

> A tiny game about flipping gravity and collecting shinies.

Skies Below is a short, unpolished puzzle platformer. Anyone can [play it online](https://www.hedberggames.com/prototypes/tableflip), for free.

## About

During the summer of 2014, I made a series of tiny, unpolished games, with each one going from idea to completion in only two weeks. Skies Below is the second game in that series, and the first one built using the [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) game engine [Flixel](https://flixel.org/).

When Flash was [discontinued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player#End_of_life), I had to [change the game to use Html5](https://www.hedberggames.com/blog/table-flip-ported-to-html-5) in order to keep it alive. To do that, I migrated the game into the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) language, using the [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) game engine. This repository captures that process - showcasing both the code from before and after the end of Flash.

## Building It Yourself

At present, there is no code in the repository, so it's not possible to build. When future commits change that, this section will be updated to reflect the appropriate process.

## Contributing

While I don't have any plans (or expectations) for accepting public contributions, if you send me a pull request, I'll be happy to look it over.

## Footnotes

Skies Below was originally released with the name "Table Flip", which was not a good fit for a bunch of reasons. That name may occasionally appear in older documentation/code.
